      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
      or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
  may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

  whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
  unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
  negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
  liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
  incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
  result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
  Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
  other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
  has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

/**
 * {@link PluginClassRouting}
 * <p>
 * 插件自定义类路由;
 * <p>
 * 使用场景：http录制/dubbo回放，通过无侵入方式无法有效隔离，插件要利用业务APPClassloader的类进行直接调用，不想通过很多反射来写，
 * 甚至像dubbo的回放，需要依赖的东西太多，打包到插件里面会增加包大小，同时会重复加载dubbo框架的类，增加很多的metaspace开销
 * <p>
 * 解决办法：由于类路由需要在{@link PluginClassLoader}初始化之前获取，无法用SPI的方式给各个插件去实现，因此只能通过配置实现，目前没有想到特别优雅的解法
 * 1. 通过定义规范的配置文件，放在插件jar包的固定位置，module通过读文件的方式进行解析。 多了一次文件IO操作，不会产生像SPI那样大的开销
 * <p>
 * 2. 通过Hard code编码在module中，缺点是插件的使用需要跟module耦合起来
 * <p>
 * 暂时先采用方案2；后续再优化
